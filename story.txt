One day, the quick brown fox jumped over the tall white fence. He barely made it over the fence, and fell on the landing, tumbling into the brush on the other side. This quick brown fox checked to see if it was hurt, hoping for the best.
Luckily, the quick brown fox only scrapped his knees, no big deal. After a day full of jumping, the quick brown fox decided to head home to visit his family. His mother and sister were home and sat down at the table to tell each other about what they had done that day. The brown fox is so tired and hungry after whole day's jumping. He heard that his mother and sister are baking the pancake in the oven.
The fox is so excited because pancakes are his favorite food in the whole wide world. He rushed to the cabinet to grab the syrup and he gets ready to eat his big stack of pancakes. The pancakes are so good that he eats 20 of them. After all the pancakes he is extremely full and tired so he decides to go to bed.
